- Webhook delivery success rate
- Payment record creation accuracy
- Error rates and types

### **Alerting Setup**
```javascript
// Example monitoring queries
// Payment success rate (last 24h)
db.payments.aggregate([
  { $match: { createdAt: { $gte: new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000) } } },
  { $group: { _id: '$status', count: { $sum: 1 } } }
])

// Failed payments (last hour)
db.payments.find({
  status: 'Failed',
  createdAt: { $gte: new Date(Date.now() - 60*60*1000) }
})
```

### **Log Monitoring**
- Monitor payment creation logs
